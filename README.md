# Minesweeper-AI-Solver
This project develops an intelligent AI agent to solve the classic game of Minesweeper. The AI is designed to autonomously navigate a Minesweeper board, using logical deduction to identify safe cells and mines. In scenarios where pure logic is not enough, the agent employs probabilistic reasoning to make calculated guesses.
