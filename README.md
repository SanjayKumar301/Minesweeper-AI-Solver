# Minesweeper-AI-SolverThis project develops an intelligent AI agent to solve the classic game of Minesweeper. The AI is designed to autonomously navigate a Minesweeper board, using logical deduction to identify safe cells and mines. In scenarios where pure logic is not enough, the agent employs probabilistic reasoning to make calculated guesses.

The project is structured in two parts to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of AI principles:

AI Logic on a Simulated Board: This phase focuses on the core AI algorithms, including knowledge representation, logical inference, and probabilistic guessing. This part of the project provides a clean environment to test and refine the AI's decision-making process without the complexities of a real-world interface.

Automated Web Solver: This advanced phase extends the AI to interact with a live Minesweeper game on a website (e.g., "Minesweeper Online"). This requires integrating computer vision to interpret the game state from screenshots and mouse automation to perform actions on the board.

üß† Core AI Principles Applied
Knowledge Representation: The AI maintains a digital representation of the board, tracking the state of each cell (e.g., covered, revealed, flagged).

Logical Reasoning: The agent applies a set of rules to deduce the location of mines and safe squares. This involves identifying clear cases where a number's value perfectly matches the number of surrounding covered or flagged cells.

Sentence-Based Logic: For more complex situations, the AI models board segments as logical sentences (e.g., "A+B+C=2") and solves them to uncover new information.

Probabilistic AI: When no logical move is available, the AI calculates the probability of each unknown cell being a mine and chooses the one with the lowest risk.
